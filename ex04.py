"""Exercise 4 from http://www.practicepython.org/
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints
out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides
evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
