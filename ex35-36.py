This exercise is Part 3 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 4.

In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names and birthdays to disk. In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists have a birthday in each month.

Your program should output something like:

        {
            "May": 3,
            "November": 2,
            "December": 1
        }

Exercise 36 Birthday Plots

This exercise is Part 4 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.

In the previous exercise we counted how many birthdays there are in each month in our dictionary of birthdays.

In this exercise, use the bokeh Python library to plot a histogram of which months the scientists have birthdays in!
