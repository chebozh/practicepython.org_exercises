"""
This exercise is Part 3 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 4.

In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names and birthdays to disk. In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists have a birthday in each month.

Your program should output something like:

        {
            "May": 3,
            "November": 2,
            "December": 1
        }
