Exercise 26

If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:

game = [[1, 2, 0], [2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]] where a 0 means an empty square, a 1 means that player 1 put their token in
that space, and a 2 means that player 2 put their token in that space.

Your task this week: given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board, tell me whether anyone
has won, and tell me which player won, if any. A Tic Tac Toe win is 3 in a row - either in a row, a column,
or a diagonal. Donâ€™t worry about the case where TWO people have won - assume that in every board there will only be
one winner.
